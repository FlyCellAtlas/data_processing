# Cross-tissue

The analyses have been run against different groups of cells based on the broad annotations defined in the cell-based extralotaed broad annotations metadata TSV file (`./extrapolated_broad_annotations_metadata.tsv.gz`). The cells were extracted from the output (.loom) of*All* Stringent analysis run. To know how the broad annotations have been defined, please see _Methods_ section.
