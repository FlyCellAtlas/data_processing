## 20200422_000__all__d6a0bcb0-84a5-11ea-8bbd-a0000220fe80

Batches: 1 + 2
Samples: all

VSN-Pipeline: `single_sample_scrublet` (aka Single-sample + Scrublet on each individual sample)

Create the config
```
nextflow config \
   -r v0.18.0 \
   vib-singlecell-nf/vsn-pipelines \
      tenx,single_sample_scrublet,singularity \
      > nextflow.config
```

Run,
```
nextflow run
   -r v0.18.0 \
      vib-singlecell-nf/vsn-pipelines \
      -entry single_sample_scrublet
```

Running time: ~40min

This run was performed mainly to remove doublets. The reports related to the doublet removal by Scrublet can be found on the Fly Cell Atlas Nextcloud as:

## 20200424_000__all__4b9e9810-8600-11ea-867e-a0000220fe80

Batches: 1 + 2
Samples: all

VSN-Pipeline: `bbknn_scenic`. This pipeline runs the `bbknn` workflow above, then runs the `scenic` workflow on the output, generating a comprehensive loom file with the combined results.

Create the config
```
nextflow config \
   -r v0.18.0 \
   vib-singlecell-nf/vsn-pipelines \
      h5ad,pcacv,bbknn,dm6,scenic,scenic_use_cistarget_motifs,scenic_use_cistarget_tracks,singularity \
      > nextflow.config
```

Run,
```
nextflow run
   -r v0.18.0 \
      vib-singlecell-nf/vsn-pipelines \
      -entry bbknn_scenic
```


Running time: ~3d 21h. (The bottleneck was the GRN inference which took ~5200min).
