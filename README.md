# Data Processing

Code and documentation for the [Fly Cell Atlas: a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the adult fruit fly](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.04.451050v1) paper.

## 10x

Contains code and documentation about the data processing of the 10x Genomics samples. The samples were processed using the [VSN-Pipelines](https://github.com/vib-singlecell-nf/vsn-pipelines/). Multiple runs were performed:

- 1 run for each tissue dataset
- 1 run will all tissue datasets (except the Blood samples which were removed because of poor quality)
